***Incomplete - will complete later***

I would like to keep this tutorial as more of a conversational blog. MS Excel is a simple, yet so powerful tool
for the data analysis/processing.
The way it presents the data in a tabular form is very intuitive and easy to use.


## Excel

Excel is extremely simple and intuitive. We have columns, rows and cells. Columns are the X-axis (A to Z and so on), while rows are the Y-axis (1-onwards).
Any cell on the Excel grid can be realized by its coordinates in the form of column+rownumber (e.g. A1, B2, C3, etc.).

## Formulae

Formulae are the heart of Excel. We can use them to apply a diverse range of operations: arithmetic, logical, text, etc.

Like, we can calculate the average value of data in columns A-C and rows 1-25 using the formula:
```
=AVERAGE(A1:C25)
```
In fact, I didn't cover most of them in the class. But here's the cool thing with formulae: you can just click on the formula bulder in the respective bar and it will show you the dialogue.
Using this dialogue, you can easily find out what the formula does and how to use it, etc.

To make things even easier, these formulae are grouped into categories. I know semester system is hectic and you are taking other courses too. But this is something you can continue exploring anytime – beyond this class too. 

## Graphs

Graphs are a very powerful tool in Excel. They can be used to visualize data in a very intuitive way.
To draw a graph, you need to select the cells you want to plot. Then, you can click on the Graph tab and select the type of graph you want to draw.

## Pivot Tables

Pivot tables are another powerful tool. They can be used to summarize data in an intuitive way.
To create a pivot table, you need to select the cells you want to summarize. Then, you can click on the Pivot Table tab and select the type of pivot table you want to create.

## Personal Story

**TL;DR**: _I was hooked to Excel due to its formulae thing._

My first-ever introduction to MS Excel (or whole MS Office suite) was way back in 1999/2000 (it used to be MS Office 97 then). 
Playing with WordArt, talking a bit with Clipy assistant and doing some other simple tasks 
used to feel so special. In fact writing it down is making me nostalgic as now a days, we have much more powerful computers, advanced tools and all that, but can't derive the same amount of pleasure
from the same tasks.

So, I was quite hooked to the MS Word, but Excel used to intimidate me due to its
whole "sea of cells" and a weird looking + sign mouse pointer.
In 2005, I got admission in BS and this Excel was part of our ICT lab.
I found it super cool due to the formulae thing and the guest teacher who came for that lab
(_he soon became my fav teacher_).

So yeah, that formula thing really hooked me and this is where I found Excel's use.
Again, I didn't use it much until I begun my software career. 
Life comes 360º and now we are in the same ICT lab.
