Recently, I took feedback from both courses. 
And while there are some positive things in my teaching, there is a handsome room for improvement, too.

Actually, I like this practice of having a feedback session and needed it even more now (returning from a 4-year break). 
I also like how Comsats gives you a week break (theory vs lab) and 10 days are a sufficient time to 
not only reflect, but also to design a line of action.

The feedback is available as a [detailed report](https://spot-sea-308.notion.site/Feedbacks-Analysis-29b06242d9688052befacbe3b19106d5) for transparency. 
For busy who can't read it, the crux of the areas of improvement is:



- **Pace & Breadth** – The biggest challenge. Covering many advanced tools rapidly, which overwhelms some students, especially non-CS backgrounds.
- **Depth vs Breadth** – Students prefer mastery of fewer topics over exposure to many.
- **Lack of Visible Structure / Roadmap** – Students want clarity on what’s covered, what’s next, and how it connects.

The last point is easy to rectify and while I can't lose my natural style by over-improvisation, 
atleast I can do a couple of things:

- Outlining the whole syllabus and upcoming topics on the repo.
- Making either a couple of slides or writing brief notes for the upcoming topics in advance. The idea of having a few slides (like most of the presenters do) is really cool, but it can only be implemented in the AI lab, where they have LCD screen and a separate whiteboard.

First two points are important, but one can't master them overnight. They are linked to two things: subject's knowledge and teaching style/skills.

By chance, I was going through my OneDrive and found old lecture videos of a course I took way back in 2013. And that prompted me to write this article.

## Personal Note – Thanks to My Teachers

I have been lucky to have learnt from some exceptional teachers. Naturally, each had his own style and approach. But **some things were common among all of them**:

- Excellent narrative-building/storytelling skills – you feel hooked.
- Communicating in a clear and concise manner (I talk much faster and hate this habit).
- Mentioning some meta-level concepts which proved to be useful beyond the class/university.

There were many concepts which I couldn't grasp and I would attribute them more towards my low IQ than teachers' fault. And that's fine – you aren't meant to learn/remember ~~anything~~ everything. 

But some things, mentioned casually in the class by them, stayed with me. For example:

- I was in the 5th class and once our teacher mentioned that "Its not the money which takes you to Hajj, but the luck does." I was super astonished to hear that and how well did it stand the test of the time.
- Then, I remember a teacher once mentioned that "Today's problems were yesterday's solutions" (In fact, there are countless pearls of wisdom shared by him – even today, when we go to meet him in UET, we end up getting a lot of knowledge by just a benign water-cooler chat).
- Again, I remember a teacher once said, "_When you say that you don't have time, it doesn't mean you really don't have time. It means that the particular thing doesn't merit enough priority for your time._"

## The Art of Teaching – Examples

Before it would start sounding like an Oct 5th post, now I would focus on the main topic: the art of teaching.

Every teacher has his/her own style and approach. So, instead of making some bullet points or "golden rules", I would purely share my personal experiences to illustrate what does art of teaching means to me (and yes, I need to follow it more).

### Pavel Pavenzer – UC San Diego

As I mentioned earlier, I saw a lecture video from a 2013 course. I would like to share some context there:

I used to hate Biology. Didn't take it even in my Matriculation. I had a little bit interest in how human brain works, EEG signals and BCI – and that's it. 
In fact, the admission I took in MS (2012) was also motivated by the urge to study EEG signals. But caps were expensive and funds were short, so didn't pursue it.

In Aug 2013, a friend suggested me to try Coursera. I loved the platform and the courses. By chance, I saw a course on Bioinformatic Algorithms (I was looking for Algorithms courses and found this).
Again, I just saw this course and had no intention of taking it (Biooo? No! Never for me). I don't remember precisely how my curiosity drove me, but I opened its [first lecture](1-1 - Where in the Genome Does DNA Replication Begin.mp4) and bingo, I was hooked.

The professor Pavel Pavenzer had excellent narrative-building skills, he knew how to deliver and arise curiosity of students to the point of begging for the answers. Even his Russian accent couldn't be a barrier and we really enjoyed the course. The reason I mentioned "we" is he introducing an open resarch group for us to discuss the course and some challenging problems. I remember I was paired up with a super-curious Indian girl and it's a pity I soon got busy in teaching (ironically) and had to put this course in the background.

In this busy life, many of you won't have time to go and check his course or video lectures, so let me summarize why he made me love the course to the point **that I did my MS thesis in Bioinformatics**:

- Excellent Teaching Skills – Keeping students interested and engaged.
- Coding Exercises – I loved those coding exercises and their automatic grading system a lot (9 years before chatGPT, mind you!). I still remember that majority of the class was doing those assignments in the Python and me alone in C#.
- Discussion Forums – Those forums were great to discuss the course with other students from other corners of the world. And there used to be some nerdy discussions on these fascinating topics.
- Quality Slides/Helping Material – The standard of those slides and video lectures was really exceptional – even for today. The way he used to write on the glass board was something very cool.

### Mernie Blewitt – Uni of Melbourne

The impact of that course was huge. I started learning convoluted concepts of Molecular Biology and made up my mind to do my research in Bioinformatics. A couple of years later, I found another cool course on Coursera: **Epigenetics**.

Again, Epignetics was such an awesome course. Its as exciting as studying Quantum Mechanics. Studying molecular genetics left me confusing about many things and it was epigenetics which answered those questions.

In the case of Mernie, again her teaching style was so good. In fact, my MS thesis in particular was focused on the Epigenetic data (non-coding RNAs).

What set Mernie's pedagogical style apart (other than her cool Aussie accent) was:

- Excellent story-telling – very good examples.
- Explaining convoluted concepts in a pretty simple way.

### Andrew Ng – Stanford

I am always skeptical about Stanford people as they are over-projected. And I don't consider Andrew Ng much of an AI researcher either. But his teaching skills are exemplary. 

Just 3,4 years ago, Andrew Ng's DL specialization was a pretty hot course and while the paradigm has drastically shifted, his teaching style is something which will always remain a template for many of us. Ng's teaching can be characterized as:

- Making students feel comfortable ("_even if you don't understand it right now, you don't need to worry about it_")
- Not only a grip on almost every aspect of AI, but presenting/teaching it in a very effective manner.
- His course had excellent programming exercises.
- The interview series in his DL specialization (that Yoshua Bengio interview was so good) gave a totally new aspect of things.

### Stephen Boyd – Stanford

In 2020, I had nothing to do, so took admission in the PhD in UET (dropped out later on). There weren't any interesting courses in the Computer Engineering dept (neither in the CS dept), so I was advised by the supervisor to take some from the western side (EE).

Luckily, I found two excellent courses there: Probability and Optimization. I was nil in Probability and that course helped me learn it to the level that I can even teach it now.

As for the Optimization course, it literally exploded my brain. Someone, who wasn't good even at Linear Algebra was studying this fancy advanced Maths. Our instructor was so good, I was enjoying it a lot and there were a couple of reasons why I loved that course a lot: the excellent book and the guy who wrote it.

Stephen Boyd is a giant: very rarely, I have seen someone who is so good at research, yet so good at teaching.
Boyd's course is Maths heavy, yet his teaching style is so good that someone without any Maths background also finds itself hooked. 

I can summarize Boyd's teaching style as:

- Passionate (I can relate more with him the way he talks with passion and relatively faster compared to the other teachers).
- Good sense of humour – you can't be bored in his class.
- Passion/Dedication for the subject
- Excellent focus – he doesn't get distracted and stays on the topic.

This article can go on forever, but I think this is enough for now. This blog is more of a mirror for me and hopefully, will help me reflect on my teaching style.
